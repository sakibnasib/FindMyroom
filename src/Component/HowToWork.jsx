    <p>Express interest by simply clicking “Like” on roommate profiles that seem as a good fit. They will be then notified and if it’s mutual, they will become a “Match” who you can chat with freely. You can also skip waiting for a "Match" and send an "Instant Message" introducing yourself to speed things up. By setting up a roommate profile you can also receive "Likes" and messages from potential roommates.</p>
